## 🚀 What is WeTracked?

WeTracked — found at wetracked.io — is the leading first-party ad tracking platform for eCommerce merchants on Shopify and WooCommerce, built to solve the single most expensive problem in performance marketing today: inaccurate conversion data. As iOS14+ privacy updates, ad blockers, and cookie restrictions have caused native ad platform tracking accuracy to collapse to as low as 40%, WeTracked restores it to 95% to 100% — not through modelling or estimation, but through a proprietary 360° Data Enrichment Engine that builds an adblock-proof digital fingerprint for every visitor, stitches sessions together server-side, and pushes a complete, accurate picture of every conversion directly back to the ad manager that drove it.

The practical result is that Meta, TikTok, Google, Snapchat, Pinterest, and X see the real data — not the partial, iOS-distorted picture that native pixels and even Meta's own Conversion API alone produce. When the algorithm receives accurate conversion data, it optimises toward the ads that are actually generating revenue rather than the ads that appear to be generating revenue through incomplete attribution — and the difference compounds over every subsequent campaign cycle. Most WeTracked users report a 50% increase in ROAS within a week of implementation, with Facebook pixel tracking accuracy reaching 93% or higher on accounts that previously showed 40% to 60% coverage. Pricing starts from $49 per month for entry-level Shopify and WooCommerce stores, setup takes under two minutes with no code required, and the platform covers ad channels including Meta, TikTok, Google Ads, Snapchat, Pinterest, and X — with a support team available every day of the week that reviewers across Trustpilot, G2, Capterra, and the Shopify App Store consistently describe as responding within minutes, including at 3am and on weekends, without exception.

## 💼 Why Choose WeTracked Over Other Ad Tracking Platforms?

WeTracked has built a reputation as the most accurate, fastest-to-implement, and best-supported ad tracking platform available to eCommerce merchants in 2026. Here is what sets it apart:

- **95% to 100% tracking accuracy where native pixels deliver 40% — and that gap is widening** — traditional pixel-based tracking, including Meta's Conversion API used in isolation, only captures data that the browser and store can collect at the point of purchase — and with iOS14+ privacy changes, cookie restrictions, and ad blockers blocking or discarding the majority of that data, native accuracy has fallen to 40% and continues to decline; WeTracked rebuilds the full conversion picture by capturing far more data points than any native pixel, stitching sessions together server-side before any blocker or privacy restriction can interfere, and pushing a complete, enriched conversion event to the ad platform — with accuracy verified at 93% to 100% by independent user testing and the platform's own money-back accuracy guarantee
- **360° Data Enrichment Engine — not modelling, not estimation, just facts** — WeTracked's core technology builds a unique, GDPR-compliant digital fingerprint for each visitor using dozens of enriched data points that go far beyond what a standard pixel or CAPI connection collects; this fingerprint persists through iOS restrictions and ad blockers and allows WeTracked to accurately link every sale, visit, and revenue event to the exact ad that generated it, without the statistical modelling and conversion window guessing that most third-party attribution tools rely on when real data is unavailable
- **Sends accurate data back to the ad platform algorithm — not just a reporting dashboard** — the critical distinction between WeTracked and most competing attribution tools is that WeTracked does not just show merchants better data in a separate dashboard while leaving the ad platform algorithm working with incomplete information; it sends the enriched conversion data directly back to Meta, TikTok, Google, and other connected ad managers in the exact API format each platform requires, feeding the algorithm the accurate signal it needs to optimise toward revenue-generating audiences rather than the ghost audiences created by missing or inaccurate conversion events
- **50% average ROAS increase within one week of implementation** — WeTracked documents and consistently verifies a 50% improvement in Return on Ad Spend as the typical outcome within the first seven days of installation, driven entirely by the algorithm's improved optimisation when it receives accurate conversion data rather than the 40% partial picture it was previously working with; this is not a projected improvement based on modelling — it is a measurable ROAS change that merchants report within days of connecting WeTracked to their ad accounts
- **Setup in under 2 minutes with no code required** — WeTracked connects to Shopify or WooCommerce via a native integration that requires no developer, no custom code, no tag manager configuration, and no technical expertise to complete; the full setup — store connection, pixel ID entry, and ad channel integration — takes under two minutes from account creation to live tracking, a setup speed that no competing server-side tracking solution of comparable accuracy matches
- **Covers Meta, TikTok, Google Ads, Snapchat, Pinterest, and X from a single integration** — one WeTracked subscription tracks and sends enriched conversion data across every major ad channel simultaneously, eliminating the need for separate tracking solutions for each platform and giving merchants a single source of accurate attribution data across their entire paid advertising mix
- **Supports Shopify, WooCommerce, Funnelish, Checkify, CheckoutChamp, BetterCart, and custom integrations** — WeTracked is not a Shopify-only tool; it supports a broad range of checkout environments and eCommerce platforms, giving merchants who use non-standard checkout solutions or custom stacks the same accurate tracking infrastructure that native Shopify merchants access through the standard integration
- **Multiple pixel support — run backup tracking across multiple ad accounts** — WeTracked allows merchants to add multiple pixel IDs so that the same enriched conversion data is sent to more than one ad account simultaneously, giving merchants who manage multiple brand accounts, agency clients, or backup ad accounts a built-in redundancy layer with no additional configuration required
- **Adblock-proof and iOS14+ proof by design — not by workaround** — because WeTracked operates entirely server-side and builds its digital fingerprint before the browser interaction where most privacy restrictions apply, the accuracy it delivers is structural rather than a workaround that future iOS updates or ad blocker iterations can degrade; the fingerprint is GDPR-compliant and built from data points that are not subject to the browser-level interception that has made client-side tracking increasingly unreliable since 2021
- **Support available every day, every hour, with sub-10-minute response times** — multiple G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, and Shopify App Store reviewers specifically cite response times measured in minutes regardless of the hour, including documented responses at 3am and late on weekends from named team members including Hans and Asad, who are described across reviews as providing custom solutions, multi-call debugging sessions, and fixes for genuinely complex and unique technical issues that other support teams would have closed as out-of-scope
- **Money-back guarantee on tracking accuracy** — WeTracked offers a refund if the data does not match real store data, a guarantee that no competing server-side tracking platform offers because most cannot make the same accuracy claim with sufficient confidence to back it financially; for merchants evaluating whether to switch from Triple Whale, Tixel, or another attribution tool, this guarantee eliminates the financial risk of testing the platform on a live ad account
- **5-star Trustpilot rating from 941 verified reviews — the highest-rated ad tracking platform of its type** — WeTracked's Trustpilot community reflects consistent five-star experiences from merchants across Shopify and WooCommerce, with reviewers citing solved tracking problems, measurably improved ROAS, fast setup, and above all a support team that multiple users describe as the best they have encountered across any software product they use in their eCommerce stack

## 🔓 Reduce Your Subscription Cost with SAVE15

WeTracked pricing starts from $49 per month — already priced significantly below the $299 to $599 per month charged by attribution platforms like Triple Whale for comparable or lesser tracking accuracy, with no code required for setup and a money-back accuracy guarantee that removes the financial risk of switching entirely. With the discount code **SAVE15**, you reduce that already accessible monthly cost by a further 15% for the first three months, making it the most affordable entry to 95% to 100% first-party ad tracking accuracy, server-side conversion enrichment sent directly back to Meta, TikTok, Google, and five additional ad channels, adblock-proof digital fingerprinting, and a support team that responds in under 10 minutes at any hour of any day available anywhere in the eCommerce tracking market today.

At 15% off across three months, the total saving is meaningful — and more importantly, it reduces the financial threshold for committing to a platform that the majority of users report pays for itself within the first week through measurably improved ROAS, reduced wasted ad spend, and an algorithm that finally has the accurate data it needs to optimise toward real revenue rather than a 40% partial picture of it.

## 🙌 Who Should Use This Code?

- Shopify and WooCommerce merchants running paid advertising on Meta, TikTok, Google, Snapchat, Pinterest, or X who are experiencing inaccurate conversion tracking, underreported ROAS, or algorithm optimisation toward the wrong audiences because native pixels and CAPI are working with 40% or less of actual conversion data
- Merchants who have tried other attribution tools — Triple Whale, Tixel, or others — and found that they display better data in a separate dashboard while leaving the ad platform algorithm itself still working with incomplete information, which WeTracked solves by sending enriched conversion data directly back to the ad manager rather than keeping it inside a third-party reporting layer
- Media buyers and performance marketing teams who need sub-10-minute support available at any hour without exception — WeTracked's support model of named team members available 24 hours a day including weekends is documented across hundreds of independent reviews and is a genuine operational advantage when a tracking issue surfaces during a live campaign at 3am
- eCommerce brands scaling aggressively on paid channels who need a ROAS improvement that compounds over every subsequent campaign cycle as the algorithm accumulates accurate conversion data — the 50% ROAS increase within a week is an entry point, not a ceiling, for merchants who maintain WeTracked integration consistently across their paid advertising
- Budget-conscious merchants who want the maximum discount available across the first three months of the most accurately reviewed ad tracking platform in the eCommerce space — 15% off with code SAVE15 is one of the highest verified discount rates currently available on any WeTracked subscription plan
